A basic tool to handle multiple clans at once.
For D2Sanctuary, but usable from everyone.

This tool will still grow, don't worry.


1) Install `python3 -m pip install requests`
2) Edit `config.py`
3) Run `01_auth_server.py`, navigate to https://localhost:8000 and log in with all your clan accounts
4) Run `02_refresh_auth_tokens.py` every time you want to use the tool.
5) Run `03_list_inactive_users.py`
